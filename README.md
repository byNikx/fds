# Front-end Development Standards
### Inspired by Google Coding standards.
This document serves as the complete definition of Bankdata’s coding standards for source code in the JavaScript programming language. A JavaScript source file is described as being in Bankdata Style if and only if it adheres to the rules herein.

Like other programming style guides, the issues covered span not only aesthetic issues of formatting, but other types of conventions or coding standards as well. However, this document focuses primarily on the hard-and-fast rules that we follow universally, and avoids giving advice that isn't clearly enforceable (whether by human or tool).

### Terminology notes
In this document, unless otherwise clarified:

1. The term comment always refers to *implementation* comments. We do not use the phrase documentation comments, instead using the common term “JSDoc” for both human-readable text and machine-readable annotations within /** … */.

2. This Style Guide uses RFC 2119 terminology when using the phrases must, must not, should, should not, and may. The terms prefer and avoid correspond to should and should not, respectively. Imperative and declarative statements are prescriptive and correspond to must.
