# Front-end Development Standards
##### Inspired by Google Coding standards.
This document serves as the complete definition of Bankdataâ€™s coding standards for source code in the JavaScript programming language. A JavaScript source file is described as being in Bankdata Style if and only if it adheres to the rules herein.

Like other programming style guides, the issues covered span not only aesthetic issues of formatting, but other types of conventions or coding standards as well. However, this document focuses primarily on the hard-and-fast rules that we follow universally, and avoids giving advice that isn't clearly enforceable (whether by human or tool).
